# WinterTraining2019
This repository contains the codes for the main topics discussed at the 2019 Winter Training in Competitive Programming organized by me at Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia.

The training was 100% free, and lasted for 5 days, with daily 4-hour classes (in Portuguese). The public was around 15 college and high-school students who wanted to do their best at ACM-ICPC and Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics.
